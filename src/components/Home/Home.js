      <h2 className='welcome-header'>Welcome to Movie_Reels</h2>
      <p>Movie_Reel is a site dedicated to the movies you love. When you register as a Movie_Reels user and Login you will have access to start making Reels of your favorite movies. Think of a 'Reel' as you would a 'playlist'. A 'playlist of songs' is a 'Reel of movies'.</p>
      <p>By making Reels you will not only have a place to save your favorite movies, and make awesome compilations, but also a way to share movies you love with others. Users will have the ability to "Search for reels like ____.". Users enter a movie they love, and then Movie_Reels find Reels that user may like based on the movie.</p>
      <p>The idea is to help our users move from a favorite movie, to a new Reel with potentially many more <strong>new</strong> favorite movies. Hopefully this app will help you find that next movie to watch, as you sink in your couch with a nice bowl of popcorn. Thanks for being a user and contributing to our community!</p>
